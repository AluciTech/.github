# Aluci

### The Foundation for Responsible, Transparent, and Native Software.

**Aluci** is a french non-profit association (Loi 1901) bridging the gap between **research** and **high-stakes software engineering**. We exist to define and defend the standards of open source.

In an era of "vibe coding" and disposable software, we stand for **technical rigor**, **long-term maintenance**, and **human-centric design**.

## Our Mission

We don't just consume open source, we aim to master its engineering. Our work focuses on three pillars:

* **Verifiable Engineering:** Promoting architecture over approximation. We advocate for memory-safe languages and automated, reproducible environments.
* **The "Hub of Trust":** We act as a third-party validator for open-source projects, applying the rigor of scientific peer-review to code.
* **AI Transparency:** We champion the use of efficient **Small Language Models (SLMs)** and mandate strict transparence.

## The Aluci Label

We provide a rigorous **Labelling Process** for open-source projects that want to prove their production readiness. A project bearing the **Aluci Certified** badge has passed our audit on:

1. **Licensing & Legal Safety** (OSI-Approved License)
2. **Technical Justification & Architecture**
3. **Automated Setup & Documentation**
4. **AI Usage Transparency**
5. **Ethical & Resource Efficiency**
